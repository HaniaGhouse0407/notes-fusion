# notes-fusion

Notes Fusion is a web application built on the Streamlit framework that offers powerful features for note summarization, image summarization, and mind map generation. Leveraging the capabilities of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), Notes Fusion provides users with an efficient and intuitive way to process and extract key information from various sources, enabling them to better organize and comprehend their notes, images, and ideas.

With the increasing volume of information we encounter daily, it becomes essential to have tools that help us condense and synthesize relevant content effectively. Notes Fusion addresses this need by harnessing the power of natural language processing and computer vision algorithms, supported by GPT, to automate the process of summarization and mind map generation.
